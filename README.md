Three django tests useful for practice

1. Model Test: This test checks if the fields of a Django model are created and saved correctly.

2. View Test: This test checks if a Django view returns the expected HTTP response status code (e.g., 200 for successful response).

3. Form Test: This test checks if a Django form validates input data correctly, both for valid and invalid data.
